- 👋 Hi, I’m Thiago Lopes Queiroz @thiagolqueiroz, Biologist with a Master in Ecology.
- 👀 I’m interested in changing careers. Right now I'm working on the environmental consulting sector as an offshore technician in a sismic reasearch vessel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and I already have a bit of experience with R, Python, HTML and CSS. I'm also good with statistics and have done my far share of data analisys (biological data). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever project that would help me become a better programmer.
